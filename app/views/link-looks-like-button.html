<h2>Test Case</h2>
<a href="https://www.registertovote.service.gov.uk/register-to-vote/start" class="button" role="button">Start now</a>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">Register to vote</a></p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>We have a button style (class="button") that is used to make inputs of type button, buttons and links look like
    buttons.</p>

<p>When a link looks like a button a user with voice recognition software (such as
    <a href="http://www.nuance.co.uk/dragon/index.htm">Dragon Naturally Speaking</a>) will/may have problems using
    the link as they will call it a button.</p>

<p>There are many instances on GOV.UK of a role="button" being added to such links as there is a expectation that
    voice recognition software will then treat is as a button. Is this assumption correct?</p>

<p>Buttons should be activated with the space bar. When you add a role="button" to a link you need to add some
    javascript so that the link/button can be activated with the space bar. This is not happening on GOV.UK.</p>
